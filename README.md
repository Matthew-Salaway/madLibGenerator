# MADLIB Generator
This program creates a MADLIB out of any story. Enter the story as either a text file or a string for the argument of the functions. The last function is a more interactive version of MADLIBS, where you enter the specified characters/objects before the story is created. Then the story is printed out with the user inputed information.
